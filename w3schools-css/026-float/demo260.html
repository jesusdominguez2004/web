    <h2>Let an image float to the right in a paragraph</h2>

    <p>
        In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image. 
        We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:
        0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the image.
    </p>
